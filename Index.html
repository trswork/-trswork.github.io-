      <p>I was born in New York City. I lived there most of my life. About six years ago, NYC was hit with multiple snow storms. That year I dug my car out of the snow, then went to Charlotte to visit family. When I returned I had to dig my car out of more snow. I made the decision to moved from NYC to Charlotte NC. <a href="www.lipsum.com.">www.lipsum.com</a> </p>
